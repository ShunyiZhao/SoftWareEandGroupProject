# TEAM6 -- BIG EATTER

## System Design
  Design process and introduction:
  Our project is a multi-functional gaming platform which is designed for gamers, watchers and game analysts.
  In the beginning, we were supposed to design a body sensing game and then, we found that maybe it was too difficult for us      to bring about an excellent idea which could attract large amount of people and achieve great success. Therefore, we changed our idea to build a gaming platform and used a simple game as example.
  Our platform is designed for gamers, watchers and game analysts to use. We would mainly provide simple and small games, and we implement a small game BIG EATER as an example. 
  With fast pace and great pressure, gaming is a wonderful way to relax. Hence, we came up with the idea to design simple and small games which do not require gamers to spend a lot of time to learn and practice the game. If gamers are tired of playing, they can turn into watchers and amend some parts of the game to interact with gamers.
Also, our software would provide processed game-related data such as game duration and game hits for game analysts, so that they can make decisions to optimize or promote the games.
  Gaming is a traditional entertainment medium and live game broadcast is rising and becoming quite popular in recent years, we would like to combine them in our software and we think that it is a new and interesting idea to let watchers interact with gamers. Additionally, data analysts can obtain the processed data to continuously perfect the gaming system.
