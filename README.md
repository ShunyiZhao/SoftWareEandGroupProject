## <span id="Intro">Introduction
  Our project is a multi-functional gaming platform which is designed for gamers, watchers and game analysts.  

  At the beginning, we were supposed to design a body sensing game and then, we found that maybe it was too difficult for us to bring about an excellent idea which could attract large amount of people and achieve great success. Therefore, we changed our idea to build a gaming platform and used a simple game as example.

  Our platform is designed for gamers, watchers and game analysts to use. We would mainly provide simple and small games, and we implement a small game BIG EATER as an example.

  With fast pace and great pressure, gaming is a wonderful way to relax. Hence, we came up with the idea to design simple and small games which do not require gamers to spend a lot of time to learn and practice the game. If gamers are tired of playing, they can turn into watchers and amend some parts of the game to interact with gamers.

  Also, our software would provide processed game-related data such as game duration and game hits for game analysts, so that they can make decisions to optimize or promote the games.
  
  Gaming is a traditional entertainment medium and live game broadcast is rising and becoming quite popular in recent years, we would like to combine them in our software and we think that it is a new and interesting idea to let watchers interact with gamers. Additionally, data analysts can obtain the processed data to continuously perfect the gaming system.

At the beginning of this term, We want to design a game like Fruit Ninja. It will be an interesting game. The paper prototype and
processing prototype is in the folder with path ./example/example_1

Then, to develop the program on M5 Stack and

## <span id="LinkToPart2">System Implementation

Because of the unforseen circumstances of COVID-19, we have to work together online. So the M5 Stack holder,
Shunyi Zhao do the works about M5 Stack and the communications between the M5 Stack and desktop application.
Yuxuan Qiu, Ben Jin and Rao Hu completed the main functions of desktop application. Kehan Du and Alex Lee 
designed the layout of our website and developed the web pages. All group members are collaborators of this
repository. They could push works they done to the dev branch of this repository directly without review of
changes in file, but a pull request from dev branch to master branch

### The works of IoT device, development of processing programme and development of Web are broken down to some simple problems:
 * M5 Stack GUI design
 * M5 Stack programming of IMU sensor
 * M5 Stack programming of serial and LCD
 * Processing programming of serial communication
 * Design the GUI of desktop application
 * Dssign the GUI of web application
 * Communication between desktop application and web application

### IoT Device - M5 Stack


## <span id="LinkToPart3">Project Evaluation
Group memebers test the part they made by themselves, and the M5 Stack holder test the whole system.
