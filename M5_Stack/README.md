# TEAM6 BIG EATER - M5 Stack and Serial Communication

## M5 Stack - senors

The Ardunio API webpage of M5 Stack:
[M5 Stack Ardunio API](https://docs.m5stack.com/#/en/arduino/arduino_api)

We used API functions of IMU(Sensor MPU9250) to get the acceleration and Euler Angels. These parameters are organised in a string, with spaces between them. At the end of this string, a character is sent to send button signal.
