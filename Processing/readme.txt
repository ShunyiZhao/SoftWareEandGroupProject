Codes in this file are meant to load game pages and to realise game rules. Loaded game pages include loading page and ending page, background page and objects moving pages when user playing, main character, foods(current foods include cheese, crab, eggplant, fish, pineapple, salad, water and hamburger), some fitness equipment, bomb and virus.
Game rules include how the foods, bombs and viruses move from top to bottom, how the main character moves from left to right and vice verse in the bottom of the page and how he eats foods to get scores, however, if the main character touches the bombs or viruses accidentally then he will lose one life(he has 5 lives in total).
Later, we will add more functions, for example, the main character can get gift boxes to get a bonus, and he can get higher score if he eats food according to provided food set. Stay tuned for updates.
